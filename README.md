HostID: Host accession number at the University of Washington Burke Museum, Ichthyology Collection
HostSp: Host species
Longitude, Latitude: Coordinates of the collection locality of the host. If coordinates were not provided by the museum (either on the jar label or from the online database), they were estimated using Google maps from the location listed by the museum.
Year: Year that the host was collected
TL: Total length of the host
SL: Standard length of the host
The rest of the columns represent parasite taxa identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Unknown taxa were either not vouchered and could not be identified, or were not able to be morphologically identified.
